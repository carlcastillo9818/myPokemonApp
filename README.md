# myPokemonApp
This app acts like a MINI pokedex (showing water types, fire types, and anymore I choose to do).  It uses standard views, images, labels, and a custom Pokemon class as well as passing data from view to view. The starting view presents different choices between pokemon types, a user clicks on one and that takes them to a new view which presents them with different Pokemon of that respective type.  After a user clicks on one of the pokemon, a third view opens and this is the one that resembles  the Pokedex, it shows a picture or gif of the Pokemon, their name, pokedex number and a description about them.
